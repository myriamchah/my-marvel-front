# An index of Marvel's characters and comics 

**Built with**: React & Vite - This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.    
**Hosted on**: Netlify & Northflank &rarr; [Check it out!](https://my-marvel-front.netlify.app/)    
    
**What could be improved?**     
This website is one of my first React project, so greatly perfectible. 
For now, favorites are stored in cookies only. User management and storage in DB are on top of the backlog!
There's still a bug allowing user to add multiple times the same item to Favs. 
Feature-wise, the website could be very much enriched, but as stated, it was just the exercice :)
